    <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem</title>
    <introduction>
        <p>
            The Law of Large Numbers (LLN) is often hand-waved as <q>averages go to the mean,</q> but there are really two distinct theorems (weak vs strong), different modes of convergence, and subtle conditions. Similary, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is one of the deepest ideas in probability, and it's often glossed over as <q>averages look normal.</q> 
        </p>  
        <p>  
            Let's take a slow, detailed walk through them. Although I do not intend our treatment here to be exhaustive, but there will be enough detail for you to get a fuller understanding of what they represent and how to use them.
        </p>
        <p>
            <alert>The Setup:</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
            The set up for both LLN and CLT is the same. Suppose you have a number of independent random variables <m>X_1, X_2, \cdots, X_n</m>, all with identical distribution functions <m>P(X)</m>, same for every <m>X_i</m>. Let <m>\mu</m> be the man and <m>\sigma^2</m> the variance of the common distribution.
            <mdn>
                <mrow xml:id="eqn-true-mean"> \amp \mu  = \langle X_i\rangle,\qquad \text{same for every }X_i </mrow>
                <mrow xml:id="eqn-true-var">\amp \sigma^2  = \langle X_i^2\rangle - \mu^2,\qquad \text{same for every }X_i </mrow>
            </mdn>
            We will call these values <alert>true mean</alert> and <alert>true variance</alert>.   
            Now, we introduce a new random variable, called the <alert>sample mean</alert> by 
            <men xml:id="eqn-sample-mean-random-variable">
                \bar{X}_n = \frac{1}{n}\,\left( X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n  \right).
            </men>
            The bar over <m>X</m> just distinguishes it from the <m>n^\text{th}\, X</m> in the collection of random variables. More importantly, <m>\bar{X}_n</m> is not one number, but a random variable, which will take values in the range given by the components <m>X_i</m>. For instance, if <m>X_i \in \{ 0, 1 \}</m>, a Bernoulli random variable, then, <m>\bar{X}_n</m> would actually take many values, here  <m>\bar{X}_n \in \{ 0, 1/n, 2/n, \cdots, (n-1)/n, 1\}</m>.
        </p>  
        <p>
            The random variable <m>\bar{X}_n</m> will have it's own probability distribution, <m>P(\bar{X}_n)</m>. We call the mean and variance of this dstribution <alert>sample mean</alert> and <alert>sample variance</alert>.
            <men xml:id="eqn-">
                \bar{\mu}_n = \langle \bar{X}_n \rangle,\qquad \bar{\sigma}_n^2 =  \langle \bar{X}_n^2 \rangle - \bar{\mu}^2.

    </introduction>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-Law-of-Large-Numbers">
        <title>Law of Large Numbers (LLN) </title>
        <p>
            The LLN addresses the question: <alert>What can we say about the mean of the sample mean <m>\bar{X}_n</m></alert> as <m>n</m> grows large? Clearly, the probability distribution of <m>\bar{X}_n</m> varies if we change <m>n</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <alert>The weak law of LLN</alert> asserts that probablity that <m>|\bar{X}_n - \mu|</m>, where <m>\mu</m> is the true mean defined above in Eq. <xref ref="eqn-true-mean"/>, can be made smaller than any positive real number as long s you go sufficiently large <m>n</m>. Mathematically, we express it as the complement of this probility.
            <me>
                \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}P(|\bar{X}_n - \mu| \gt \epsilon ) = 0,\qquad \text{for all } \epsilon\gt 0.
            </me>

            That is, the probability that <m>\bar{X}_n</m> strays outside of <m>\mu \pm \epsilon</m> goes to zero as <n>n \rightarrow \infty</n>. 
            This result is also expressed in a more compact notation, with a letter <m>P</m> above arrow implying <q>in probability</q>.
            <me>
                \bar{X}_n \xrightarrow{P}\, \mu.
            </me>
        </p>
        <p>
            <alert>The stron LLN</alert> uses a different criteria. You look at the sequency of sample random variables <m>\bar{X}_n</m> with increasing value of <m>n</m> and ask if these random variables themselves ted to <m>\mu</m>. The claim is
            <me>
                P(\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} = \mu) = 1.
            </me>
            We say that <m>\bar{X}_n</m> <alert>almost surely</alert> converges to <m>\mu</m>, the true mean. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Although nt that hard, the proofs of these results are beyond these notes.
        </p>
        <p>
            For an <alert>intuitive feel</alert>, imagine tossing a fair coin. Suppose you toss it <m>n</m> times. For varying values of <m>n</m> you might find:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <m>n=1</m>: <m>X_1</m> = 1 if heads and 0 if tails, with <m>\mu = \langle X_1 \rangle = 0.5</m>. <m>\bar{X}_1 = X_1</m>, hence, <m>\langle \bar{X}_1 \rangle = \mu</m>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Suppose you flip the coin 10 times, now you have 10 variables, since outcome of each flip is a random variable in its own right. We usually, think of the tosses same experiment done 10 times. With this, <m>n = 10</m>. Suppose, you got <m>(1,1,0,0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1)</m>. That would mean, for this experiment, you got the following value of the sample mean, <m>\bar{X}_{10} = 0.7</m>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        f you flip 100 times, the value of the sample mean variable in any one set of 100 tosses will usually be close to <m>0.5</m>, say <m>0.501</m> 
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Now, if you tossed the coin then <m>10,000</m>, you would get even closer to <m>o.5</m>. 
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            This is LLN in action. The strong law says: with probability 1, the sequence of averages converges to 0.5.
        </p>
 
        
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-Central-Limit-Theorem">
        <title>Central Limit Theorem</title>
        <p>
            The Central Limit Theorem says that regardless of the distribution <m>P(X_i)</m> of <m>X_i</m>'s, which may be Bernouli, Binomial, Exponential, or whatever, the distribution of a <m>\bar{X}_n</m> tends towards a bell-shaped Gaussian wil larger and larger values of <m>n</m>. Specifically,
            <men xml:id="eqn-CLT">
                \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\, \bar{X}_n \xrightarrow{d} \, \mathcal{N}\left(\mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right),          
            </men>
            where <m>d</m> above arrow just indicates the result is to be understood as converging <q>in distribution</q> and <m>\sigma^2</m> is the true variance of the component <m>X_i</m> variables. In terms ofprobability this means 
            <me>
                P(x \le \bar{X}_n \le x+dx) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\, \exp\left( - \frac{( x - \mu )^2}{2 \sigma^2/n}  \right)\, dx.
            </me>
        </p> 
        <p> 
            In applications of this formula, it is convenient to express it in another form by shifting the random variable <m>\bar{X}_n</m> and scaling the result.
            <men xml:id="eqn-the-Zn-variable">
                \bar{Z}_n = \frac{ \sqrt{n}\left( \bar{X}_n -\mu \right) }{\sigma}.
            </men>
            Then, you can show that <m>\bar{Z}_n</m> has a standard normal distribution, which lends itself to looking up standard tables and standard computations.
            <men xml:id="eqn-the-normalized-CLT">
                \bar{Z}_n \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1).
            </men>
            the CDF of standard normal is denoted by <m>\Phi</m> instead of <m>F</m>.
            <me>
                \Phi(z) = P( \bar{Z}_n \le z ) = \int_{-\infty}^z\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\, \exp\left( - \frac{z^2}{2}  \right)\, dz.
            </me>
        </p> 
        <p>     
            Let's emphasize once again the fact that the convergence to a Gaussian happens regarless of the original distribution of <m>X_i</m>'s. This is why we see Gaussian curves everywhere in nature — measurement errors, heights, test scores, etc. aren't inherently normal, but they are aggregates of many small random effects.

                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Specifically, deviations are of order <m>1/\sqrt{n}</m>, and tend towards a Gaussian.
                            </p>
                        </li>

                </li>

            <alert>How large is <m>n</m> when we say n large?</alert> A rule of thumb is that often <m>n \ge 30 </m> is enough.

There is actually a mathematical result that quantifies the rate of convergence. Berry-Esseen Theorem gives rates of convergence.

            and let us denote the CDF of standard normal, <m>\mathcal{N}(0,1)</m> by the Greek letter, <m>\Phi</m>. This is a standard notation. We keep <m>F</m> for other distributions. Then, Berry-Essen Theorem states that

Shevtsova (2011) showed <m>C \le 0.4748</m> and the best known lower bound is <m>C \ge 0.4097</m>. IExact value is not that important since in most applications <m>C \approx 1</m> is enough.

            The CLT says that as <m>n \rightarrow \infty</m>, <m>F_n \rightarrow \Phi</m>, and Berry-Esseen theorem tells us the rate at which this approach occurs. It says that the difference shrinks as <m>1/\sqrt{n}</m> with a "tail-heaviness" factor <m>\rho/\sigma^3</m>.

            <alert>Why LLN Matter?</alert>
        </p>
        <p>
            In statistics, we distinguish between a sample mean and a population mean. The population mean, also called true mean <m>\mu</m>, is usually not known since we either do not have access to every point of interest, we only look at a small part. For instance, when we poll the population on some issue, we do not ask everybody, we just take <alert>sample</alert>. The LLN gives us confidence that if <m>n</m> is <alert>large enough</alert>, sample mean will be close to the population mean.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a numerical illustration of how sample mean <m>\bar{X}_n</m> <q>hugs</q> the true mean as <m>n</m> gets large, consider rolls of a fair six-sided die, whose faces are labeled <m>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6</m>. The true mean of these rolls will be just 
            <me>
                \text{True Mean}, \mu = 3.5,\qquad \text{Estimated Mean}, \bar{X}_n \approx 3.5.
            </me>
            Can you see how this can be shown? Anyway, let's roll this die <m>n</m> times and plot the sample means of the results obtained in rolls for various <m>n</m> values. This is shown in <xref ref="fig-die-rolls-sample-mean-vs-true-mean-x"/>. You can see that As the number of rolls increases, the sample mean stabilizes around <m>3.5</m>

But, if we knew the true mean, we wouldn't need the estimated mean.
        </p>   -->
        <!-- <p> 
            In the absence of any knowledge of the true mean, how do we make any conclusion about how good a estimate we have. That's where we can use Central Limit Theorem. According to the CLT, even though we do not know the true distribution of our original problem of random variables <m>X</m>, by repeatedly performing the experiment that measures <m>X</m> in an identical manner, say <m>n</m> times, we can claim that the mean of these <m>n</m> experimental outcomes has a Gaussian distribution whose mean and standard deviation are related to the mean and standard deviation of individual <m>X</m> themselves.
        </p> -->
        <p>
            Let us look at the fair six-sided die rolls. Suppose, want to answer the question: what is the mean of face value of a roll of a single die? The result of a signle roll is a random variable, which are calling <m>X</m>. Of course, each time you roll the die, you will get a single value from <m>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \text{or}, 6</m> in a equiprobable way. From this you can calculate the true mean to be <m>\mu = 3.5</m>, and standard deviation <m>\sigma = \sqrt{35/12}</m>, which is left as an exercise for you. (Just use the mean and variance formulas.)
            <me>
                \mu = 3.5,\quad \sigma = \sqrt{35/12}.
            </me>
            Now, we are going to pretend that we didn't know these values and want to figure out the mean by doing experiments and generating data. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To get the estimates of mean and standard deviation, we can just roll the die <m>n</m> times, say for <m>n=100</m>. The outcome of this experiment will be a sequence of face values, <m>\{X_1 = 2, X_2 = 5, X_3 = 1, X_4 = 3, \cdots, X_{100}=4 \}</m>. The average, denoted by <m>\bar{X}_{n}</m> and standard deviation of this data can be an estimate of the corresponding true quantities. Since <m>n=100</m> is fairly large number, the law of large numbers tells us that the average will be a good estimate of <m>\mu</m>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Suppose you got a value of <m>\bar{X}_{n} = 3.6</m> in our first try of a 100 rolls. Now, when you repeat another <m>100</m> rolls, you will get another set of data, <m>\{X_1 = 5, X_2 = 1, X_3 = 6, X_4 = 1, \cdots, X_{100}=2 \}</m>. Their average and standard deviation will be different from what you got the first time. Say, for average you got this time <m> \bar{X}_{n}= 3.55</m> this time. 
        </p>  
        <!-- <p>  
            Clearly, <m>\bar{X}_{n}</m> is a random variable. The good news is that Central Limit Theorem tells us that the distribution function of <m>\bar{X}_{n}</m> is a Gausian, whose mean and standard deviation are related to the true mean <m>\mu</m>,  true standard deviation <m>\sigma</m> of the individual rolls, say roll number <m>1</m>, whose random variable is <m>X_1</m> with all rolls being identical, and the number of rolls in one experiment, here <m>n=100</m>. For clarity, I will state the CLT result here a little differently making use the probability of values of the random variable <m>\bar{X}_n</m>.
            <me>
                P(x \le \bar{X}_n \le x+dx) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\, \exp\left( - \frac{( x - \mu )^2}{2 \sigma^2/n}  \right)\, dx
            </me>
            Of course writing in such details is not necessary as long as we keep the prpbablity part in the back of our ming and instead, use the following notation, which means the same thing.  
            <men xml:id="eqn-clt-gaussian">
                \bar{X}_n \sim \mathcal{N}\left( \mu, \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\right).
            </men>
            OF course, we still do not know the true mean and true standard deviation. So, we can estomate them by repeating sets of <m>n</m> rolls, each set of 100 rolls, being one trial. 
        </p> -->

            A simulation of <m>N=10000</m> repeats of this <m>100</m>-roll experimets is presented in <xref ref="fig-confidence-interval-die-roll"/> as a histogram. The theoretical true mean is near the peak of the Gaussian as expected. But, if we didn't know the value of the true mean, we will need to guess where it is. That guess can be quantified with a degree of confidence in the guess. The figure shows a range of values of the sample mean (the abscissa in the plot) within which there is <m>95\%</m> chance of finding the true <m>\mu</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is the breakdown of how the confidence interval was obtained. Let's recall that as per CLT for a large <m>n</m>.
            
            <!-- First we re-write the Gaussian result as a standard Gaussian by shifting and scaling the random variable to get a new random variable, which is to the left of the following equation.
            <men xml:id="eqn-clt-standard-gaussian">
                \frac{\sqrt{n}\left( \bar{X}_n -\mu \right)}{\sigma} \sim \mathcal{N}\left( 0, 1\right).
            </men>
            Since we do not know the true <m>\mu</m> and <m>\sigma</m>, we replace them with the one we can estimate from our rolls, which I will denote by <m>\mu_\text{est}</m> and <m>\sigma_\text{est}</m>.
            <men xml:id="eqn-clt-standard-gaussian-approx">
                \frac{\sqrt{n}\left( \bar{X}_n -\mu_\text{est} \right)}{\sigma_\text{est}} \sim \mathcal{N}\left( 0, 1\right).
            </men>           
            Or, we can equivalently do the following. -->
            <men xml:id="eqn-clt-gaussian-approx">
                \bar{X}_n  \sim  \mathcal{N}\left( \mu, \frac{ \sigma^2 }{n}\right),
            </men>
            where <m>\mu</m> and <m>\sigma</m> are the true mean and standard deviation of the random variabel <m>X_1</m>. The last quantity is sample variance
            <men xml:id="eqn-sample-variance">
                \text{Sample Variance} = \frac{ \sigma^2 }{n}.
            </men>
            This is often referred to as theoretical result. When we simulate the experiment as done in <xref ref="fig-confidence-interval-die-roll"/>, you can get estimated sample mean as well the estimated sample variance directly from the experiment and don't need to divide it further by <m>\sqrt{n}</m>. Thus, using the quatities from the simulation, we will write the CLT as follows.
            <men xml:id="eqn-clt-gaussian-approx-simulation">
                \bar{X}_n  \sim  \mathcal{N}\left( \mu_\text{sim}, \sigma_\text{sim}^2 \right),
            </men>
            where I am using the subscript <m>\text{sim}</m> to indicate the simulation quantities.
        </p>  
        <p>              
            
            Here, we want a <m>95\%</m> confidence interval (in other applications you may want <m>99\%</m> CI or whatever), which is just the range of values around the mean that covers the <m>95\%</m> of the area under the curve in the Gaussian function. That will leave <m>5\%</m> area outside, which will be <m>2.5\%</m> on the right and <m>2.5\%</m> on the left. That's where we can use the inverse of the CDF <m>F(x)</m>. If we solve
            <me>
                F(x) = 0.95 + 0.025 = 0.975, 
            </me>
            we will get the value of <m>x</m> that is the right edge. By symmetry, we will go to the left edge, or for the left edge solve
            <me>
                F(x) = 0.025.
            </me>
            These points will be
            <me>
                x_\text{right} = F^{-1}(0.975),\quad x_\text{left} = F^{-1}(0.025).
            </me>
            Altough plot in <xref ref="fig-confidence-interval-die-roll"/> does not show the normalized Gaussian, in practice it is common to shift and scale to the <m>Z</m> vartiable as defined above.
            <me>
                \bar{Z}_n \equiv \frac{\left( \bar{X}_n -\mu_\text{sim} \right)}{\sigma_\text{sim}} \sim \mathcal{N}\left( 0, 1\right).
            </me> 
            Then, it is easy to get the left and right values of <m>\bar{Z}_n</m> by using a standard library function, such as <code>ppf()</code> shown in the program listed below. This gives
            <me>
                 x_\text{right} =  \mu_\text{est} + z_\text{right} \times \sigma_\text{sim},

                 x_\text{left} =  \mu_\text{est} + z_\text{left} \times \sigma_\text{sim}.
            </me>
            The range <m>[x_\text{left}, x_\text{right}]</m> gives the range of <m>\bar{X}_n</m> values within which at the chosen confidence level, here illustrated for <m>95\%</m> that the true <m>\mu</m> is expected to reside.
