# ML Notes

In this book I will type up my notes on ML that I have taken over years. Hopefully, it will be useful to some students out there.

The main source file is `source/main.ptx`.  This includes the other chapters of the book.

To compile the book as an accessible website, run `pretext build web` in a terminal from any directory of this project.

To preview your output, run `pretext view web`.

The currently completed parts of the book should also be availble at the GiiHubPages site: mlnuts.github.io.
